Summary\n","\n","The overall results of this model display an accuracy of 63%, sensitivity of 37%, and specificity of 75%. This model outperformed the neural network accuracy by over 8%. And specified the model’s capacity to predict when the eye is not open when it truly was not, by over 45%. However, the model’s ability (sensitivity) to detect whether the eye was open when true, was  near-equal to that of the neural network.\n","\n","These results suggest the model not to be practical for this specific test. Though logistic regression serves as a great model to predict binary predictors (0 and 1), the accuracy of this test and area under the curve indicate moderate predictive capability. Some aspects that may improve the model performance may\n","\n","The model may be further improved in two ways. 1) Setting cutoff values for logistic regression to categorize eye movement may better capture precise results. However, with a mean value of eyeDetection around .5, varying the cutoff value may not change the model performance in this specific case. 2) Using reported p-values after fitting the model to determine statistically significant effects may also yield better results. From our model, the least ‘important’ indicators (beta values) seem to be O2, O1, and F8 as they seem to be insignificant on the effect of eye detection.\n"]}]}
