I have finally gotten around to using Rselenium! The first time I had heard of this was from one of my good friends who was web scraping off of Python. It actually took me a long time to figure out how exactly I was supposed to use it because it was rather difficult for me to grasp the concept as a new learner.

In layman terms, RSelenium is an R version of a website testing platform. This means that Selenium allows the automation of website actions just as if you are pointing and clicking. This means that the usage of this tool is not only used for testing web apps, but can be used for scraping information on the web, or performing certain tasks that need to be done recursively. Of course, R may not be the easiest nor the best way to use the Selenium server (There seem to be better methods with other IDEs. ie. Firefox Selenium IDE) but the whole point of this blog is expanding the reach of R as an analytical tool.

We'll get started right away.

Unfortunately, since I last loaded the package, it has become defunct. I found out later it was because the dependencies `binman` and `wdman` were deleted from the CRAN server due to "checks" problems. Don't ask me too many details, because I am no any expert. Good thing we can access the archived RSelenium and old dependencies!

```{r}
library(devtools)
### install_version("binman", version = "0.1.0", repos = "https://cran.uni-muenster.de/")
### install_version("wdman", version = "0.2.2", repos = "https://cran.uni-muenster.de/")
### install_version("RSelenium", version = "1.7.1", repos = "https://cran.uni-muenster.de/")
library("RSelenium")
```

If you are super picky about the "proper" way to use things, there is yet another administrative task we have to go through in order to use RSelenium. You also need to get our hands on Docker  as rsDriver is not currently working. To solve this, make sure to go  and download Docker from this [site](https://store.docker.com/) after creating an account. It's free. Don't worry. Yet, I am not really in the mood to run through two separate ways to run Selenium, so I will show you how I use this. If you're interested in using Docker, check out this [cool resource](https://callumgwtaylor.github.io/blog/2018/02/01/using-rselenium-and-docker-to-webscrape-in-r-using-the-who-snake-database/) with animal species analysis using Rselenium. A little different from what I am intending to do.

We initially will begin by using the `rsDriver()` function with the correct port and browser information. Usually, as a developer tool, Firefox is the main, but since I bought this new laptop I have not once touched it. I suggest if you are following along, use Chrome browser to access Selenium. 

```{r}
browse <- rsDriver(port=4444L,browser="chrome")$client
```

Now that we have our browser, let's start playing! Here's a demonstration with our beloved google. This is what a split view of what will pop up as soon as you type in the url. 

```{r}
url <- "https://google.com/ncr"
browse$navigate(url)
```

One important aspect to note is unique ability of Selenium to act as if we are actually pointing and clicking on the information, so sites will not suspect us to be 'bots'. Even when we are automating any searches, we won't be knocked out for 'suspicious activity'. 

Of course there will be times when we may get blocked (I do all the time), but all we need to do is scan each page with an `if` `else` and if it so happens that a bot comes up, we can just make sure to click the appropriate box. For extreme cases, there may be a "find an image that has a car" type of dialog. Those might be more of a challenge, but I can imagine that this can be taken care of with tensorflow or some other visual machine learning tool. Who knows? For now, all I know is my limited ability to scrape the internet!

Anyways, back to our browser. Every step requires that we identify the exact element that we are searching for, then perform an action (Just like pointing and clicking). Unfortuantely, we can't just point and click (Aww..). Yet, luckily for us we have really great tools at our dispense. Our CSS selector gadjet from chrome (or Firefox) and the inspect element item. The CSS selector tool is probably my favorite. It is a chrome addon that I use all the time. Yould probably get by with only using the CSS selector because it has an Xpath searching functionality. Yet if we have both tools, we will have a much easier time getting what we need. I will not be showing you how to use the CSS selector here, but the internet has plenty of resources on how you can take care of that on your own!

Here, we see that our browse value has an option to `findElement()`. We will specify that we found the search box with the css selector, then paste in the CSS code. You will see the cursor move blink on the text box just after you run this line.

```{r}
wxbox <- browse$findElement(using = 'css selector',"#lst-ib")
```

Now to start typing, we will use the new object that we have created and use the option to `SendKeysToElement(list())`. Inside goes our search term. 

```{r}
name <- "Walmart"
wxbox$sendKeysToElement(list(name))
```

You'll notice immediately that the screen will start to type on it's own and work just like you were online (You can also see what people tend to type with 'Walmart' ahaha).

To search, now, is just as easy. We just find the element that specifies the search button and we `$clickElement()`. Interestingly, you'll notice if you run the first line below, there may be a problem. It will tell you that the element you are looking for is not visible (thus impeding you from clicking the button). No worries! There are work arounds to these things. Just `findElement()` to a new location or just find the inside search button. Both of which is included below.

```{r}
# This is the original search button
browse$findElement(using = 'css selector', value = "center input")$clickElement()
# This is the tertiary search button
browse$findElement(using = 'css selector', value = "span input")$clickElement()
```

I feel as if I've hit the jackpot with odd search items. The Florida man jailed story actually says "Florida man jailed for stealing $1.16 worth of doughnuts from Walmart, deputies say". No comment.

You can also pull out specific images or text from the page. This will usually require an xpath for ease. I have already gone and grabbed it, but if you are curious how to pull out the xpath, take a look at one of my older [posts](https://tykiww.github.io/2018-01-05-luhn-with-rvest/).

Say we wanted to pull out the industry marker and explanation from this page. We will begin by finding the xpath for both of those items.

```{r}
xp1 <- '//*[@id="rhs_block"]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/span'
xp2 <- '//*[@id="rhs_block"]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/span[1]'
```

We'll then  move on to obtaining the specific element. Where we specified "css selector", we can fill two objects as industry and explanation and pull them out using `$getElementText()`.

```{r}
industry <- browse$findElement(using = 'xpath', value = xp1)
explanation <- browse$findElement(using = 'xpath', value = xp2)
item1 <- industry$getElementText()[[1]][1]
item2 <- explanation$getElementText()[[1]][1]
```

Pretty simple huh? I'll just finish by column binding the strings, then we have ourselves a mini-dataset.

```{r}
c(name,item1,item2)
```

    ## [1] "Walmart" 
    ## [2] "Retail company"
    ## [3] "Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of 
    ## hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores."

When I showed this to my brother, he said something along the lines of, "Can't you just do this with your mouse?" Which is true. He had me there. It seems like such a roundabout way to perform one simple task.

However, we cannot forget, this is for testing and automating web apps. Just last week, I was creating a summary report for a manager and he needed me to sort through information for over 700 Japanese companies and identify key industries that identified with our product markers. I wasn't ready at that moment to go through every page, so I decided to create a link of 400 companies, sorted them by industry (cutting them down to about 1/3) then automating summary articles for me to glaze over. What would have taken me about an hour or so, with diminishing returns, to weed through only took about 20-30 minutes. Cutting my time by half.

Learning productivity comes at a cost for time, but ends up as a valuable investment for your future.

This was just a simple introduction to Selenium. There are many more things you can do, but it's more fun to explore on your own!

At the bottom you'll see a function I use to scrape a huge pile of customer review data on a specific cushion toilet seat from Amazon. I searched for the highest  ratings to study why people like or this particular brand to find the most common reasons for leaving a response for purchase. IF I happened to be creating the new top-selling 'super cushy toilet seat' I would love to know what kinds of preferences are out in the market. 

```{r}
# Begin Driver
browse <- rsDriver(port=4444L,browser="chrome")$client

# amazon cushy toilet seat reviews.
url <- "https://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-Toilet-Molded-Easy-Clean-Change/product-reviews/B00004T158/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
# opened up the comments page.
browse$navigate(url)
# Found 5 star reviews
xpath5 <- '//*[@id="histogramTable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/a'
fivestar <- browse$findElement(using = 'xpath', value = xpath5)
fivestar$clickElement()
# get base url
nurl <- fivestar$getCurrentUrl()[[1]][1]
ogurl <- nurl %>%
  substr(1,nchar(nurl)-1)


# set up for loop that goes through 50 pages and collects all 5 star ratings.
ll <- c()
rat <- list()
for ( i in 1:50) {
  ll[i] <- ogurl %>%
    paste(as.character(i),sep = "")
  browse$navigate(ll[i])
  ch <- browse$findElement(using = 'css selector', value ="#cm_cr-review_list" )
  rat[[i]]<- ch$getElementText()[[1]][1] %>%
    strsplit("\nReport abuse\n")
}

```
