Compounding is easy. Howevr, not if youdo it by hand.






```{r}
# create columns
r <- seq(0,1,by = 0.05)
n <- 0:20
a <- matrix(NA,21,21)
colnames(a) <- r
rownames(a) <- n

# find just the compounding margin
# subtract out the simple interest from 
# total binomial calculation.
for (j in 1:length(n)) {
  for(i in 1:length(r)) {
    a[j,i] <-  ((1+r[i])^(n[j]) - (1+r[i]*n[j]))
  }
}
# Select columns of interest
a <- a[,-c(1,12:21)]


rbind(r,(72/(100*r))) %>% View 


a[c(1:6,11,16,21),] %>% View
```
