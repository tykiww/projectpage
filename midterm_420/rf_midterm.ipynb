Summary\n","\n","We notice that the out of bag score for the random forest model is acutely high > 86%. This result suggests 14% and greater of the predicted values in the \"out of sample\" data (unused in in the creation of the tree), is accurate. Furthermore, since our values of .oob_score_ fall way beyond 50% (by 46) our ensemble outperforms just flipping a coin by more than 46%, \n","\n","Furthermore, using an alternative Accuracy scoring method, our best gridsearch cross validation metrics indicate high accuracy with a maximum depth of 50 (92%). The result indicates a high percentage of correct prediction out of total number of predicted values. This fold had the lowest estimate of overfitting compared to all other cross validated random forest models.\n","\n","Our five most important indicators include: 'O1', 'P7', 'F7', 'F8', and 'AF4'."]}]}
